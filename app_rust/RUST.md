# Rust Best Practices:

1. Choose the rocket (https://rocket.rs/) framework for Rust development, which offers the following advantages:

   - Simplifies the process of writing fast and secure web applications, while maintaining flexibility, usability, and type safety.

   - Provides type safety to avoid common errors.

   - Eliminates boilerplate code, enhancing development efficiency.

   - Easy to use, allowing for a smooth development experience.

   - Offers extensibility to customize as needed.

   - Note: Building with a stable toolchain requires the rc version of the framework.

2. Utilize rustfmt to format the code effectively.

3. Ensure code quality by utilizing clippy for linting.

4. Implement pre-commit hooks to automatically lint the files.

5. Perform unit tests for the application using cargo test.

## Unit Tests:

- Develop tests to verify that the application returns the current time in ISO format.
