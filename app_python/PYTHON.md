# Python Best Practices:

1. Utilize Poetry for effective dependency management, which offers the following benefits:
 - Provides a lock file to ensure version control

 - Separates development and production dependencies

 - Resolves conflicts between different versions

2. Implement pre-commit hooks to automatically lint the files.

3. Utilize linters to ensure code quality:
 - flake8 ensures adherence to code style guidelines.

 - isort and black facilitate consistent code formatting.

4. Ensure code style uniformity by applying formatting during pre-commit.

5. Opt for the production-ready framework, fastapi (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), known for its exceptional features:
 - High performance comparable to NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.

 - Increase development speed by around 200% to 300%.

 - Reduce human-induced errors by approximately 40%.

 - Intuitive with excellent editor support, minimizing debugging time.

 - Designed for easy usage and quick learning to reduce time spent reading documentation.

 - Minimize code duplication and prevent bugs through optimal use of parameter declarations.

 - Deliver production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.

 - Compliant with open standards for APIs, including OpenAPI (previously Swagger) and JSON Schema.

6. Clearly specify the versions of the utilized packages.

7. Avoid running production code from the root directory.

8. Execute unit tests during build time to simplify the development pipeline.

9. Adopt pytest for unittests due to its user-friendly features:
 - Simplicity of usage.

 - Ability to collect coverage data.

## Unit Tests:

- Implement tests to verify that the app returns the current time in ISO format.
