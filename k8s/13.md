### App is working and available

```bash
curl -H "Host: python.app" http://192.168.49.2/visits
124
```

### visits check

```bash
kubectl exec -it pod/python-app-helm-0 -- cat /app/volume/visits
204
kubectl exec -it pod/python-app-helm-1 -- cat /app/volume/visits
163
kubectl exec -it pod/python-app-helm-2 -- cat /app/volume/visits
148
```

We have so large number of visits due to `Readiness` and `Liveness` probes.

Also we can see, that scheduling influence number of `Liveness` probes count (as we start from 0 and check up to latest replica).

### Why Ordering Guarantees Might Be Unnecessary for Your App

Our application components are stateless, so they don't depend on a specific startup or shutdown order.
Stateless apps can scale up or down independently without any specific sequence.

### Implementing Parallel Operations in StatefulSets

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: <>
spec:
  podManagementPolicy: Parallel
```

### Parallel

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE       NAME                                        READY   STATUS      RESTARTS       AGE

```

We can see that now pods were started in parallel (we have equal AGE column on all pods {0,1,2}.

## Bonus

### Everything was applied to Rust app too

### Explore Update Strategies

#### Rolling Deployment: This is the default approach where pod updates occur without causing downtime. It systematically replaces pods with an older application version with those running the newer version.

#### Recreate Deployment: This method updates the application instantaneously but incurs some downtime. It works by terminating all existing pods and then launching new ones with the updated version.

#### Ramped Slow Rollout: This technique gradually introduces replicas of the new version while concurrently phasing out the old replicas.

#### Best-Effort Controlled Rollout: This strategy employs a "max unavailable" setting, denoting the maximum percentage of pods that can be down during an upgrade, facilitating a faster rollout.

#### Blue/Green Deployment: In this strategy, two identical but separate environments are created. Users are gradually shifted over to the new environment.

#### Canary Deployment: This method represents a gradual delivery model, where the main user base interacts with one version of the application, while a smaller group tests a newer version. If the new version proves successful, it's gradually rolled out to more users.

#### Shadow Deployment: The latest application version, termed the "shadow" version, processes real-world traffic in parallel with the current version, but without impacting end-users.

#### A/B Testing: This approach involves rolling out two or more variations of an application feature to a segment of users at the same time, allowing for the assessment of performance based on user engagement, error rates, or other key performance indicators.
